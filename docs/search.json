NVivo is a program which helps researchers to organise their sources, and help with the coding and analysis of the data. This one day workshop will provide an introduction to NVivo and using it to do thematic analysis. Topics covered during the day will include\n\nTour of NVivo and its capabilities\nGetting data into NVivo\nCoding, querying and visualising your data\nUsing NVivo to help with thematic analysis\n\nThe day will run from 10am to 4pm with morning and afternoon breaks, and an hour for lunch.\nBook here"
